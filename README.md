## Background
In this project, I used JavaScript to build on top of the provided HTML and CSS files for QTrip.
I implemented dynamic functionality such as fetching Cities, Adventures, Adventure Details and Reservations from a backend server. The JavaScript code will fetch this information and manipulate the DOM of the HTML page to make the site interactive.
